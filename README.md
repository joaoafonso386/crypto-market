# The Challenge

In this challenge, we are asking you to build an application that allows to you search a cryptocurrency and show some detailed data relative to that coin. You can use any framework or tool you want in order to develop this.

1. Have a web page that allows searching a coin in the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) list of coins
2. Add the coin to a dashboard that shows at least the name, logo and current price of the coin
3. Show a detailed view of the coin that includes more coin details, showing at least coin description, market cap and volume traded in Euro

Requisites:

- At least two pages, one for the dashboard and another for consulting the details of a certain coin
- Given that this is a front-end challenge we are expecting some level of expertise to be demonstrated on the styling of the application. Great design skills are not expected, but using a framework like Bootstrap or Foundation is discouraged. If you want to use something to speed things up in other to focus elsewhere, we recommend Tailwind.
- Host the code in a GitHub repository with some instructions on how to run the project locally
- Although not needed, you can use some of the free hosting platforms to deploy your code, such as Vercel, Netlify and Heroku, should you want to.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
